This was a project based on FTC, a robotics competition consisting of an autonomous period, and a driver-controlled period. Because the parts to buy the official products would be absurdly costly, I chose to opt for a much cheaper solution, Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi's have support for motors, using control boards. This project aims to have a robot that is drivable with WASD through a locally hosted website, or with controller support. The robot would also have the ability to direct itself to a QR code autonomously.
